Are there concepts that the human brain can never comprehend?

It seems impossible to teach dogs to understand quantum physics. So similarly, there might be comparable concepts that our brain cannot grasp.

This question is interesting because if the answer is yes, there exists a cognitive limit to our understanding of the world. Such limit can manifest in ways that we aren't aware, for we don't know what we don't know, and yet, it stands there to limit our civilization as if it's the law of nature.

That would be unfortunate. I'm hopeful that artificial intelligence can help human overcome the deficiency of the unaided brain. For life is beautiful and human is ambitious. Reaching toward Type I in the Kardashev scale will require tremendous amount of intelligence. Reaching toward Type II and III might require understanding reality in ways that the unaided brain isn't prepared.

In some way, AI is just a tool for us to achieve what we want. After all, isn't it the characteristic of human to build tools to compensate for capabilities that we lack.

And if this tool plays out nicely, that would be a very beautiful future.
